Things to try when debugging:
- Confirm the clock polarity and phase
- Confirm clock frequency
- Check for metastability
- Make sure inputs are debounced
- Give chip more time to respond
- Check responses to commands during initialization:
  - CMD0:   expects 8'h00
  - CMD8:   expects 48'h00xxxxx100xx
  - CMD55:  expects 8'h00
  - ACMD41: expects 8'h01, 8'h01, ..., 8'h00
  - CMD58:  expects 48'h00xxxxxxxxxx
